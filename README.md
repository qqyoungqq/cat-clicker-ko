## Cat Clicker application - Knockout version  
Mini project of Udacity course "JavaScript Design Patterns"

### Project Overview
The application is build on Model-View-View Model (MVVM) pattern using Knockout

The application should display:
* a list of cats by name
* an area to display the selected cat

In the cat display area, the following should be displayed:  
* the cat's name
* level of the cat (Newborn, InFant, Child, Teen, Adult)
* number of clicks for the cat
* a picuture of the cat 
* a list of the cat's nicknames

### Instructions on how to run the application
* Visit my Github page (http://qqyoungqq.github.io/cat-clicker-ko/).
* Click a cat name in the list to select a cat.  The cat display area will update to show the data for the selected cat.
* Click the cat's picture. The number of clicks for that cat should increment and the level of the cat should change accordingly.
